# rpn-calc

This is a NodeJS project to build out a bunch of random 'stuff' around the common 
RPN (Reverse Polish Notation) Calculator. The idea was to start with basic 
calculator functionality as a class and go from that point adding new things as I go.

The project is not designed to be a calculator but a learning tool for picking up
Javascript/Node.

Here is my task list that I would like to do

- Learn more Node/JS
- Build out a rpn calculator service
- Add a bunch of HP Calculator functionality like the HP11C as I have one
- TDD/Unit Testing with Jest
- i18n integration for language, possibly numbers
- Winston Logging
- Sequalize to do user tracking or some such use
- ExpressJS to expose it as a service
- Phase 2 would be build a front end with multiple tools like Vue and React

---

The core of the project was stolen from the numerous courseware/bootcamp projects
floating around the web, and mainly just the idea for the basic calculator class.

This project will not be anything expected to be functionally useful other than
learning how to do things. 

Feel free to offer suggestions, coding tips, and contribute if you find yourself 
having time to waste or want something to do until the next season of Rick and Morty
comes out.

Happy Coding!
